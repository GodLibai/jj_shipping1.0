                    only on its behalf, but also as an agent and trustee for such person or vessel.

                    delivery of the Goods or the date when the Goods should have been delivered, failing which the Carrier shall be
                    discharged from all liabilities whatsoever in respect of the Goods. If any payment is made by the Carrier to the
                    Merchant in respect of any claim arising from the combined transport carriage, the Carrier shall be
                    automatically subrogated to or given all rights of the Merchant against all others including pre-carrier or
                    on-carrier or Sub-contractor on account of such loss or damage. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed a
                    waive of any rights that the Carrier may have against a pre-carrier or on-carrier or Sub-contractor for indemnity
                    or otherwise

                    Carrier and/ or on-carrier in the order and condition described in this Bill of Lading.<br />
                    (2) The Carrier, its servants, agents and Sub-contractors shall be discharged from all liabilities whatsoever
                    unless suit is brought within one year after the delivery of the Goods or the date when the Goods should have
                    been delivered.

                    arising out of the carriage of the Goods not only during the carriage, but also during the period prior to and/or
                    subsequent to the carriage. The exemptions from liability, defenses and limitation of liability provided for herein
                    or otherwise shall apply in any action against the Carrier for loss or damage or delay, howsoever occurring and
                    whether the action be founded in contract or in tort and even if the loss, damage or delay arose as a result of
                    unseaworthiness, negligence or fundamental breach of contract. Save as is otherwise provided herein, the
                    Carrier shall in no circumstances whatsoever and howsoever arising be liable for direct or indirect or
                    consequential loss or damage or loss of profits.<br />
                    (2) The Carrier does not undertake that the Goods will be transported from or loaded at the place of receipt or
                    loading or will arrive at the place of discharge, destination or transshipment aboard any particular vessel or
                    other conveyance at any particular date or time or to meet any particular market or in time for any particular use.
                    Scheduled or advertised departure and arrival times are only expected times and may be advanced or delayed
                    if the Carrier shall find it necessary, prudent or convenient. The Carrier shall in no circumstances whatsoever
                    and howsoever arising be liable for direct, indirect or consequential loss or damage caused by delay.<br />
                    (3) If the stage of the combined transport during which loss or damage occurred can be determined, the liability
                    of the Carrier shall be governed by the national law(s) and/or international convention(s) applicable thereto. If
                    the stage of the combined transport during which loss or damage occurred cannot be determined, the
                    Merchant and the Carrier agree that it shall be deemed that the loss or damage occurred aboard the Carrier's
                    Vessel. In either case, clauses 5(2) and 7 shall apply.
                </p>
                <p class="texttitle">7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>
                <p class="textcon">
                    (1) Except as provided for in Clause 7(2), this Bill of Lading shall be subject to the provisions of the Maritime
                    Code of the People's Republic of China as provided for in Clause 26(1). Neither the Carrier, its servants, agents,
                    Sub-contractors nor the Vessel shall in any event be liable for any loss of or damage to the Goods in any
                    amount exceeding the limits per package or unit prescribed by that Code, unless the nature and value of the
                    Goods have been declared by the Merchant before shipment and inserted in this Bill of Lading (Box 11) and the
                    Merchant has paid additional Freight on such declared value.<br />
                    (2) Where carriage includes carriage to or from or through a port or place in the United States of America, this
                    Bill of Lading shall be subject to the provisions of the United States Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1936 (US
                    COGSA) and any amendments thereto, as provided for in Clause 26(2) hereof. In such event, neither the
                    Carrier nor its servants, agents, Sub-contractors and/or the Vessel shall in any event be liable for any loss of or
                    damage to the Goods in an amount exceeding the limits per package or unit prescribed by US COGSA, unless
                    the nature and value of the Goods have been declared by the Merchant before shipment and inserted in this
                    Bill of Lading (Box 11) and the Merchant has paid additional Freight on such declared value.<br />
                    (3) If a legal regime other than the Maritime Code of the People's Republic of China or US COGSA is
                    compulsorily applied to this Bill of Lading, the liability of the Carrier, if any, shall not exceed the limits per
                    Package or Shipping Unit prescribed therein, unless the nature and value of the Goods have been declared by
                    the Merchant and inserted in this Bill of Lading (Box 11) and the Merchant has paid additional Freight on such
                    declared value.<br />
                    (4) For the purpose of this Clause 7, the declared value shall be the basis for calculating the Carrier's liability, if
                    any, provided that such declared value shall not be conclusive on the Carrier, and further provided that such
                    declared value does not exceed the true value of the Goods at destination. Any partial loss or damage shall be
                    adjusted pro-rata on the basis of such declared value.

                    (3) If the Merchant fails to take delivery of the Goods during a reasonable time or whenever in the opinion of the
                    Carrier the Goods are likely to deteriorate, decay, become worthless or incur charges whether for storage or
                    otherwise in excess of their value, the Carrier may, at its discretion, without prejudice to any rights which he
                    may have against the Merchant, without notice and without any responsibility whatsoever attaching to him,
                    unstuff, sell, destroy or dispose of the Goods at the sole risk and expense of the Merchant, and apply any
                    proceeds of sale in reduction of the sums due to the Carrier from the Merchant. The aforesaid unstuffing shall
                    constitute due delivery hereunder and thereupon all liability whatsoever of the Carrier in respect of the Goods
                    thereof shall cease.<br />
                    (4) Where the Carrier is obliged to hand over the Goods so carried into the custody of the port, customs or any
                    other Authorities at the Port of Discharge or Place of Delivery and the Goods are delivered by the same to the
                    Merchant without necessity of production of this Bill of lading by the Merchant as required by the local law,
                    regulation and/or practice, such hand-over shall constitute due delivery to the Merchant under this Bill of Lading
                    and thereupon the liability of the Carrier in respect of the Goods shall entirely cease.<br />
                    (5) Refusal by the Merchant to take delivery of the Goods in accordance with the terms of this Clause,
                    notwithstanding its having been notified of the availability of the Goods for delivery, shall constitute an
                    irrevocable waiver by the Merchant to the Carrier of all and any claims whatsoever relating to the Goods or the
                    Carriage. The Merchant shall be liable for any losses, damages, expenses and liabilities incurred and sustained
                    by the Carrier arising from such refusal, including but not limited to, the return of the Goods to their place of
                    origin.
                </p>
                <p class="texttitle">23. GENERAL AVERAGE AND SALVAGE</p>
                <p class="textcon">
                    (1) General Average shall be adjusted at any port or place at the Carrier's option according to the York-Antwerp
                    Rules 1974, as amended in 1990, and any other amendments thereto. The Merchant shall give such cash
                    deposit or other security as the Carrier may deem sufficient to cover the estimated General Average
                    contribution of the Goods before delivery.<br />
                    (2) In the event of the Master considering that salvage services are needed, the Merchant agrees that the
                    Master shall act on its behalf to procure such services to Goods and that the Carrier may act on its behalf to
                    settle salvage remuneration. The Merchant shall timely and fully provide cash deposit or other security to the
                    salvor without affecting the schedule of the Vessel after the salvage, failing which the Merchant shall be liable
                    for any losses arising therefrom and sustained by the Carrier.

                <p class="texttitle">24. BOTH-TO-BLAME COLLISION</p>
                <p class="textcon">
                    The Both-to-blame Collision Clause currently published by the Baltic and International Maritime Conference is
                    deemed to be incorporated into this Bill of Lading.

                <p class="texttitle">25. NON-VESSEL-OPERATING COMMON CARRIER</p>
                <p class="textcon">
                    If this Bill of Lading is accepted by a Merchant acting as a non-vessel-operating common carrier (NVOCC),
                    who has in turn concluded other contracts of carriage with third parties, the NVOCC hereby warrants that the
                    contracts concluded by him in respect of the Goods subject to this Bill of Lading shall incorporate the terms and
                    conditions of this Bill of Lading. The NVOCC further warrants to indemnify the Carrier, its servants, agents and
                    Sub-contractors against all consequences of his failure to do so.
                </p>

                <p class="textcon">
                    (1) This Bill of Lading is governed by the laws of the People's Republic of China. All disputes arising under or in
                    connection with this Bill of Lading shall be determined by the laws of the People's Republic of China and any
                    action against the Carrier shall be brought before the Shanghai Maritime Court.<br />
                    (2) Notwithstanding the provision of Clause 26(1), where carriage includes carriage to or from or through a port
                    or place in the United States of America, this Bill of Lading shall be subject to the provisions of the US COGSA,
                    which shall be deemed to have been incorporated herein and nothing herein contained shall be deemed a
                    surrender by the Carrier of any of its rights, immunities, exceptions or limitations or an increase of any of its
                    liabilities under US COGSA. The provision cited in the COGSA (except as may be otherwise specifically
                    provided herein) shall also govern before loading and after discharging as long as the goods remain in the
                    Carrier's custody of control.
                </p>
                <p class="texttitle">27. VARIATION OF THE CONTRACT</p>
                <p class="textcon">
                    No servant, agent or Sub-contractor of the Carrier shall have the power to waive or vary any terms of this Bill of
                    Lading unless such waiver or variation is in writing and is specifically authorized or approved in writing by the
                    Carrier.
                </p>
                <p class="texttitle">28. NEW JASON CLAUSE</p>
                <p class="textcon">
                    In the event of accident, danger, damage or disaster before or after the commencement of the voyage resulting
                    from any cause whatsoever, whether due to negligence or not, for which, or for the consequences of which, the
                    Carrier is not responsible by statute, contract or otherwise, the Goods and the Merchant jointly and severally
                    shall contribute with the Carrier in General Average to the payment of any sacrifices, losses or expenses of a
                    General Average nature that may be made or incurred and shall pay salvage and special charges incurred in
                    respect of the Goods. If a salving ship is owned or operated by the Carrier, salvage shall be paid for as fully as if
                    the salving ship belonged to strangers.
